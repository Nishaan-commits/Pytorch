    Working with images in PyTorch (using the MNIST dataset)
    Splitting a dataset into training, validation, and test sets
    Creating PyTorch models with custom logic by extending the nn.Module class
    Interpreting model outputs as probabilities using Softmax and picking predicted labels
    Picking a useful evaluation metric (accuracy) and loss function (cross-entropy) for classification problems
    Setting up a training loop that also evaluates the model using the validation set
    Testing the model manually on randomly picked examples
    Saving and loading model checkpoints to avoid retraining from scratch
