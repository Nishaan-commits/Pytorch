1.    Find a dataset online (see the "Where to Find Datasets" section below)
2.    Understand and describe the modeling objective clearly
        - What type of data is it? (images, text, audio, etc.)
        - What type of problem is it? (regression, classification, generative modeling, etc.)
3.    Clean the data if required and perform exploratory analysis (plot graphs, ask questions)
4.    Modeling
        - Define a model (network architecture)
            -> Use a pretrained model with/without pretrained weights and Build a Custom Model
        - Pick some hyperparameters
        - Train the model
        - Make predictions on samples
        - Evaluate on the test dataset
        - Save the model weights
        - Record the metrics
        - Try different hyperparameters & regularization
5.    Conclusions - summarize your learning & identify opportunities for future work
6.    Publish and submit your Jupyter notebook
7.    (Optional) Write a blog post to describe your experiments and summarize your work. Use Medium or Github pages.
